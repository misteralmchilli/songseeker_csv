# songseeker_csv
Creating some missing songseeker csvs for the project https://github.com/andygruber/songseeker

Includes Python scripts to gather/crawl metadata for Hitster cards (including automatic Spotify, isrc and youtube searches).

See create_csv.py for usage. This is for experimentation only! This repo is not claiming any usage/owner rights to any of the original data/music/texts.
Do not misuse the Spotify API. Always interact with Youtube while preserving all usage rights. 
Support Jumbo Games and buy the card versions of Hitster.
