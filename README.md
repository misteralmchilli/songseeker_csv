# songseeker_csv
Creating some missing songseeker csvs for the project https://github.com/andygruber/songseeker

Includes Python scripts to gather/crawl metadata for Hitster cards (including automatic Spotify, isrc and youtube searches).

See create_csv.py for usage. This is for experimentation only! This repo is not claiming any usage/owner rights to any of the original data/music/texts.
Do not misuse the Spotify API. Always interact with Youtube while preserving all usage rights. 
Support Jumbo Games and buy the card versions of Hitster.

Status (Automatic crawled results unless "Chk" is set):
|File|Edition|Chk URL|Chk Year|
|---|---|---|---|
|hitster-de-aaaa0025.csv|Bayern 1 Expansion| X | X |


Results will after cleanup be submitted as pull requests to the repo here:
